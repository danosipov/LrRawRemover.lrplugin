Lightroom plugin to remove RAW versions of files

I set my camera to record both RAW & JPG photos. Lightroom imports the two files as the same photo, so I can manage the two files as one photograph. After editing, I only keep RAW files for a few select photos, but Keep JPGs for others. This plugin allows me to remove just the RAW versions for the photos.
